# Darkwind UI

This is a basic Darkwind UI for Mudlet.

Current features:

* Mapper that uses GMCP to link rooms
* Basic aliases to do things with mapper (use `map help` to see)

## Updating

Using VSCode is a simple, rich way to update code. Install VSCode, and install Delwing's [Mudlet
Scripts SDK Extension][mudlet-sdk]. Enable the extension with the command pallette (F1 by default)
by choosing `Mudlet Docs: Enable`.

Building requires [Muddler][muddler].
